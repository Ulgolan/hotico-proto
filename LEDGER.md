# LEDGER — hotico-proto

## Entry #1 — 2026-08-02 — Lap 0: forge

**Scope:** scaffold the repo. Foundation only, no screens.

**Created:**
- `index.html` — hello page: logo + "HOTICO — prototype în construcție",
  Raleway/DM Sans via Google Fonts, `noindex,nofollow` in head
- `css/tokens.css` — the five colors, two fonts, neomorphic shadow,
  480px body max-width
- `css/main.css` — hello-page layout only
- `js/main.js` — empty placeholder
- `docs/STATE-MAP.md`, `docs/POLARIS.md`, `docs/DOSSIER.md` — stubs,
  Tower-authored content pending
- `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `LEDGER.md`
- `assets/` — unzipped from `hotico-starter.zip`: `brand/` (logos, style
  guide v1.1 PDF, 10 icons, 4 patterns) and `img/` (hero-torso,
  7 service strips, temp-1x set). Zip moved to Trash, not deleted.

**Notes / debts:**
- Service strips are **1x proto-grade**. A 2x re-export is owed before
  anything leaves prototype status.
- Gallery imagery is **pending consent confirmation** — not yet cleared
  for use.

**State at close:** local preview only. Awaiting ACP's eye before GitHub
push and Vercel connection.

**Certification:** Lap 0 certified by Commander's eye; prototip wording
fixed; Tower docs delivered to docs/; launch.json footprint in parent
folder noted.

## Entry #2 — 2026-08-02 — Lap 1a: homepage, static

Branch `lap-1a-homepage-static`. Frame A resting states, sections a–i,
one commit each. **Zero JS** — `js/main.js` untouched, no inline handlers.
Reference frames (Aug 1 pair) copied to `docs/reference/`.

### Rulings carried in
- **FB icon → WhatsApp per Commander; canonical URLs used; WA number
  is +41 (dossier E19 note).** All four socials `target="_blank"
  rel="noopener"`, in hero and footer.
- **Band wording per frames; supersession applies to lockup only,
  C11 open.** Band reads "Descoperiti HOTICO Dermopigmentation
  Institute"; header/footer use the RESTAURATION INSTITUTE lockup.
- Footer nav typo fixed: frame reads "Servici", built as **"Servicii"**
  (typo law).
- Duplicate "Marina" review shipped as designed (DOSSIER D15).
- Footer tel: `+40723344555`.

### Token amendment — canon v1.1.1, values MEASURED from Homepage A.png
Sampled at y=570, rule span x=26..363 (337px), symmetric fade:

```
--gold-grad: linear-gradient(90deg,
  var(--ivory) 0%, #DAC49E 16%, #CEB27B 28%,
  #C9A86A 50%,
  #CEB27B 72%, #DAC49E 84%, var(--ivory) 100%);
--gold-line: #C9A86A;
--white:     #FFFFFF;
--card:      #E9E9E9;
```

Measured stops verbatim, edge → centre: `#F0EBE4 0.0%`, `#EAE2D2 3.3%`,
`#E4D8C0 7.1%`, `#E2D3B8 11.0%`, `#DFCEAF 11.3%`, `#DCCAA7 15.7%`,
`#DAC49E 16.0%`, `#D4BB8C 21.1%`, `#D1B683 27.6%`, `#CEB27B 27.9%`,
`#C9A86A 37.1%–62.9%` (core plateau), then mirrored.

**Finding that contradicts the amendment's premise:** there is no
metallic gold gradient anywhere in frame A. Pill borders, arrow circles,
social circles and the video frame are all **flat #C9A86A** (verified by
pixel census: 1869 px on the social circles, 347 px on the video frame,
zero non-AA neighbours). The only gradient is the section divider rule
above. What read as "metallic" at low resolution is the marble
photography plus `--shadow-neo`.

**Deviation pending ruling:** the amendment named `--white:#FFFFFF` for
"pill/card grounds". Measured, those grounds are flat **#E9E9E9** — a
deliberate step *darker* than the ivory page, which is what the
neomorphic separation rests on. Built with a new `--card:#E9E9E9`;
`--white` retained as ratified and used for the burger circle and icon
glyphs. **`--card` is not a ratified token name.**

Two further values measured rather than invented, no new tokens:
- inactive stepper bars `#F7BADC` = `--hotico-pink` at 25% on ivory
  → built as `rgba(254,9,144,.25)`
- pink CTA is a 2px pink ring + 1px ivory inset + pink fill (frame A
  y2516–2519), not a pale-pink border
- placeholder glyph colour `#9E9E9E` (darkest sampled px) — the one
  value with no token and no derivation; flagged.

### Service strip mapping (numeric match against docs/reference)
| Service | Strip |
|---|---|
| Areola | strip-01 |
| Cicatrici | strip-02 |
| Alopecie | strip-03 |
| Sprancene | strip-03 |
| Eyeliner | strip-04 |
| Buze | strip-05 |

**strip-03 and strip-06 are two export variants of the same
photograph**, and frame A uses that photograph for both Alopecie and
Sprancene (mean pixel diff 5.8 — same image, different crop offset).
strip-06 fades to black, wrong against an ivory pill, so strip-03 serves
both. **strip-06 is currently unused** — awaiting ruling.

### Debts opened this lap
- `video-thumb.png` (temp-1x) ships with the gold frame **and** the
  "▶ 3mn" badge baked into the pixels. CSS frame + badge were built,
  then suppressed to stop them doubling. Request a clean photo-only 2x
  export so both become token-driven again.
- Header ground measured `#F1F1F1` vs page `#F5F5F5`; built with
  `--ivory` to hold the colour law. Imperceptible, logged for honesty.
- Favicon not built this lap (out of key scope). STATE-MAP names the H
  kintsugi symbol — `assets/brand/icons/icon-8.png` or `icon-9.png`
  are the candidates.
- Service strips remain 1x proto-grade (carried from entry #1).

**State at close:** pushed, not merged. Awaiting Commander's eye on the
Vercel preview URL.

### Eye passed — rulings, 2026-08-02

**Canon v1.1.2 accepted.**
- **Flat gold law:** every gold surface is flat `--gold`. Confirmed as
  canon, not just a measurement.
- `--gold-grad` is the **divider rule only**. Not to be reached for
  anywhere else.
- `--card:#E9E9E9` **RATIFIED** into tokens.css.
- `--placeholder:#9E9E9E` **added**; the naked CSS value is gone.
  `main.css` now holds no brand colour outside tokens — the only hexes
  left are `#000` as mask alpha and the three Romanian flag colours,
  both annotated in place as deliberately outside the colour law.

**Debts confirmed and carried:**
1. `video-thumb.png` — clean photo-only **2x export** owed, so the gold
   frame and "3mn" badge return to being token-driven.
2. **strip-06 retired** — duplicate export variant of strip-03.
3. **NEW —** *"divider soft-shadow bloom per frame A is weaker/absent
   in build; Commander taste note, scheduled Lap 1b."*
4. Service strips remain 1x proto-grade (from entry #1).
5. Favicon (H kintsugi) still unbuilt — out of Key #2 scope.

**Merged to main** on the Commander's word. Lap 1a sealed.
